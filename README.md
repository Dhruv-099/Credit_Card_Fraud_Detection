Overview
The main focus is on implementing and assessing the performance of different classification models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, to predict outcomes based on given datasets. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Contents

Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for model training.

Random Forest Model: Implementation of a Random Forest classifier with accuracy, ROC, and confusion matrix evaluations.

XGBoost Model: Implementation of an XGBoost classifier with similar performance metrics.
Model Comparison: Comparison of model performances based on accuracy, ROC AUC, and thresholds.


Key Functions
buildAndRunRFModels: Trains and evaluates a Random Forest model.
buildAndRunXGBoostModels: Trains and evaluates an XGBoost model.
Plot_confusion_matrix: Plots the confusion matrix for visual evaluation of model predictions.
